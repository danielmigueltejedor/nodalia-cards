## [0.2.0-beta.3] - 2026-05-01

### Added

- Shared internationalization module (`nodalia-i18n.js`): language packs for **es**, **en**, **de**, **fr**, **it**, and **nl**; `resolveLanguage` from card `language` (`auto` or fixed code), Home Assistant locale, `navigator.language`, with **es** as fallback; `resolveHass` fallback via `document.querySelector("home-assistant")?.hass` when the editor has no `hass` yet.
- Lovelace editor string maps (`nodalia-editor-ui.js`), generated from `scripts/editor-source-strings.json` and `scripts/gen-editor-ui.mjs`, exposed as `window.NodaliaI18n.editorStr(hass, configLang, spanishText)`.
- Single-file bundle (`nodalia-cards.js`) via `npm run bundle` (`scripts/build-bundle.mjs`).
- Supporting scripts under `scripts/` for editor i18n maintenance (patch/wrap helpers, etc.).

### Changed

- Card editors resolve labels, section titles, hints, and select options through `_editorLabel` → `editorStr` (e.g. advance vacuum, alarm panel; broader coverage across entity, climate, graph, navigation bar, fan, favourite, person, weather, and related cards on this branch).
- Runtime UI on integrated cards uses `window.NodaliaI18n` for states, modes, navigation browse labels, and related strings where wired.
- `package.json` includes the `bundle` script; README and CONTRIBUTING updated as on the branch.

### Fixed

- Editor UI generator (`gen-editor-ui.mjs`): safer regex ordering (longer phrases before shorter ones), word-boundary rules where needed (`Borde`, `Radio`, `Icono`), correct stripping length for `__H__:` / `__T__:` prefixes, hints no longer passed through Spanish `reps` twice, `ROWS` deduplicated by Spanish key for stable `buildMap`, and `Show` / `Enable` / `Open` locale shims only on compact English labels so long hint sentences are not mangled in de/fr/it/nl.

### Removed

- Large binary GIF assets from the repository where applicable (smaller clone).

### Notes

- Prefer loading `nodalia-cards.js` (or the HACS `filename`) so i18n and editor maps register before opening card editors.
- Optional card option: `language: auto` or `es` / `en` / … to override runtime and editor language.
- Some long editor hints may remain in **English** for **de / fr / it / nl** until explicit translations are added in the generator or a dedicated hint table.
